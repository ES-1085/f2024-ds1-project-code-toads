## Summary

For our final project we worked with data from Promise Early Education. Promise Early Education is a Head Start and Early Head Start program that works with vulnerable children to encourage educational growth. This program is committed to serving low-income, vulnerable families by providing high-quality early education and extensive family support. Their main mission is to ensure children’s overall well-being, and the program is currently operating in 17 classrooms across six sites. To track child development Promise uses the GOLD® Assessment System which is a realistic, standards-based, authentic assessment tool. This assessment measures their development in six key areas: social/emotional, physical, language development, literacy, cognitive, and mathematics knowledge and skills. These datasets measure scores in these various domains for children aged 0-5 and determine whether they are meeting expectations based on the widely held expectations (WHE) scores for each age range. The variables in the dataset include bottom expected scores, top expected scores, number of children, average scores, number of children below score range, percent of children below score range, number of children in score range, percent of children in score range, the domain tested, age of children, the season, and the year. Teachers use this data as a means of monitoring progress, planning individualized instruction, and supporting each child’s growth. With this data we are exploring the various trends seen within  Promise Early Education, particularly the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the several categories of child development in the years that followed it. According to the National Library of Medicine, “there has been an increase in children with developmental delays, learning disabilities, and behavioral disorders” (Mulkey, Bearer, Molloy). COVID-19 has influenced developmental delays in many age-groups, inspiring us to use the data to see if there are effects on the younger children in this program. In order to look for developmental delays we primarily worked with the percenting meeting/exceeding variable, to see how that number has changed throughout the years. We broke up the data into three categories: Pre, During, and Post COVID-19. For Pre COVID-19 we used the data from 2018-2019, for during COVID-19 we used the data from 2020-2021, and for post COVID-19 we used the data from 2022-2023. We made three different visualizations to visually see any developmental changes during these years.
